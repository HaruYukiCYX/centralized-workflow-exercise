**Fish Soup Recipe**

**Ingredients**
1 lb (450g) mixed fish fillets (e.g., cod, salmon, haddock), cut into chunks
1 cup (240ml) mixed seafood (e.g., shrimp, mussels, clams), shells removed (optional)
2 tablespoons olive oil or unsalted butter
1 medium onion, diced
2 carrots, peeled and diced
2 celery stalks, diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves (or ½ teaspoon dried thyme)
1 bay leaf
1 can (14.5 oz/411g) diced tomatoes (with juices)
4 cups (950ml) fish or vegetable broth
1 cup (240ml) heavy cream or coconut milk (vegan option)
Salt and black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (optional, for thickening)
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
Lemon wedges and crusty bread for serving


**Instructions**

1. **Sauté the Aromatics**:
In a large pot, heat olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add onions, carrots, and celery. Cook for 5-7 minutes until vegetables soften. Stir in garlic, thyme, and bay leaf; cook 1 minute until fragrant.

2. **Thicken the Base (Optional)**:
Sprinkle flour over the vegetables and stir to coat. Cook for 1-2 minutes to create a roux.

3. **Add Liquid and Simmer**:
Pour in diced tomatoes, broth, and season with salt/pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes until vegetables are tender.

4. **Add Fish and Seafood**:
Gently stir in fish chunks and seafood (if using). Cook uncovered for 8-10 minutes, or until fish flakes easily with a fork and seafood is opaque.

5. **Blend (Optional)**:
For a creamy texture, use an immersion blender to puree part of the soup (leaving some chunks for texture). Alternatively, blend half the soup in a regular blender and return to the pot.

6. **Finish with Cream**:
Stir in heavy cream or coconut milk. Heat until warmed through (do not boil). Adjust seasoning to taste.

7. **Serve**:
Ladle into bowls, garnish with parsley, and serve with lemon wedges and crusty bread.


**Notes**
- For a heartier soup, add 1 cup diced potatoes during step 3.
- Dairy-free? Use coconut milk and omit butter (use olive oil instead).
- Seafood lovers: Add mussels or clams during the last 5 minutes of cooking.
